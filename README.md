# scikit-learn-example


## Installation

Please make sure you are on ubuntu desktop.

I did not test these codes on Mac or Windows, but it should work I think.

```
git clone https://github.com/gtt116/scikit-learn-example
cd scikit-learn-example
./setup.sh
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Done.
